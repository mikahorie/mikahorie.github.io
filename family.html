  My grandfather came to America to pursue his dreams as a scientist, 
  he came to America to get his PhD. At the time my grandparents came 
  it was during the 60s mainly known as the Civil Rights Movement era 
  so they were discriminated. Due to that, my grandfather could not 
  chose which school he wanted to get his PhD in and instead it was 
  already decided. The college was in Kansas. I mean Kansas out of 
  all places. That had to live in terrible conditions. 
  I am not exaggerating. Literally one of the places they rented to 
  stay was infested with bugs and they couldnâ€™t afford to have a 
  person to exterminate them. Even though they save up money for the 
  trip and stay in America, they were only allowed to bring a 
  maximum of about 200 dollars. That is so little. Think about it-- 
  you only have 200 dollars to pay for food, clothing, an apartment, 
  tuition for school, etc. You are barely living. 
  Turns out every month they had only 1 cent of spare money.  
  But to my grandparents it was worth everything. Thanks to their 
  hard work and perseverance, my grandfather did get his PhD. 
  Sadly, however my grandmother was super close to getting her PhD 
  in Japan but had to live to go to America.   Her main dream 
  never came true even after they had a better life and had 
  my dad and aunt.
  Including me there are 4 people in my family. My mom, my dad, 
  my younger brother, and me. We live in a nice house it includes 
  three bedrooms, a front yard, and back yard.
