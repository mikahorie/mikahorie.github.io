         </p> My life in California is fabulous and because it is amazing, 
         I would like to talk a little about it. California is a huge place 
         and it is a suburban, urban, and rural place. The area where I live 
         is called Silicon Valley. It is known for all the large tech companies 
         such as Apple because the headquarters are there.  Unlike Japan, 
         California, or lets just say America, makes everything large such as 
         food, cars, roads, buildings, etc. so if anyone comes you will be 
         surprised. People who come visit for the most part may think that 
         California only has beaches but that is wrong. There are many ski 
         resorts at the border of Nevada where it snow every year such as 
         Lake Tahoe. It may not be as good as the one in Japan but for many 
         Californians it is a treat because many places like Silicon Valley 
         rarely snows.<p>
