         My life in California is fabulous and because it is amazing, 
         I would like to talk a little about it. California is a huge place 
         and it has suburban, urban, and rural areas. The area where I live 
         is called Silicon Valley. It is known for having the headquarters of 
         all the large tech companies like Apple.  Unlike Japan, 
         California-- or let's just say America-- makes everything large.  
         Food is supersized, cars and roads are wide, buildings are large, etc. 
         so if anyone comes here from abroad, you will be surprised. 
         People who come visit for the most part may think that 
         California only has beaches but that is wrong. There are many ski 
         resorts by Lake Tahoe at the border of Nevada where it snows every year.
         It may not be as good as the one in Japan but for many 
         Californians, it is a treat because many in places like Silicon Valley 
         it rarely snows.<p>
