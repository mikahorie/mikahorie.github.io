      <h3><P> My life in California is fabulous and I love living here.
I would like to talk a little about the state I live in. California is the third largest state in the United States.
 Do you know that the size of California is about the same size of Japan? 
 Just want to let you know that it takes about 11 hours to come to San Francisco from Tokyo by air. 
 There are many non-stop flights between California and Japan. </P>  

 <P> The area where I live is called Silicon Valley. 
It is known for having the headquarters of all the large world famous tech companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft. </P> 

<P> In California -- or let's just say in America--  we make everything large. Food is supersized, roads are wide, houses are huge, etc. so if anyone comes here from abroad, 
they will be surprised how much space we have. 
People may think that California only has beaches but that is wrong! There are many ski resorts by Lake Tahoe at the border of Nevada where it snows every year. </P> 
If you go to Southern California, you will see a desert called Death Valley. 

<P> We got Disneyland, Universal Studios, Lego Land, Sea World, Great America, and a lot more attractions.</P> 

<P> Much of California has a Mediterranean-like climate with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. We got just hit by heat waves for a week in August and it caused a storm with lightning. 
Because of that we were in power outage for more than 31 hours a few weekends ago.  </P> 
<P> It was unbearable to stay in the house when the temperature hit 40 degree celsius. 
That dry lightning caused wild fires and destroyed my favorite national parks.  Global warming is real!!</P> 

<P> More than anything California is known to have a diverse community and people come from all over the world. 
 We are exposed to different cultures every day and that makes California so unique. There so many international restaurants and I enjoy trying all types of cuisines without traveling around the world. </P>
