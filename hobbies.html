 <h3> <p> My hobbies are Reading, Dancing, and Watching tv. </p>

    <p>  I love reading because I am able to learn so much about something without reading it in a boring way, unless it’s a textbook. I love reading about World War II because
   I’d love to learn how women took different roles and how WWII opened the door for women to have more jobs than ever before.
   Did you know that Julia Child the person we know as a chef was originally working for the FBI agency during World War II? It is always fun to learn something new!</p>
  
   <p> My passion is dancing! I have been dancing since I was three year old. I used to dance Tap, Jazz, and Ballet, 
  but I have come to choose ballet and take lessons twice a week. Right now I am on pointe shoes which is tiring but a great experience.</p>
   I am hoping to keep dancing for the rest of my life.
  
   <p> Last but not least, watching tv is something I enjoy too. Ever since quarantine has started, 
  I have been watching all types of tv series and movies on Netflix. Some of the all time best movies and t.v. series I have watched during quarantine are: Star Wars, Back To The Future, Victorious, Karate Kid, and k-drama. 
  
  <p>  All these hobbies made me who I am and bring happiness to my life.</p>
