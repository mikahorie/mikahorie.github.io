    My hobbies are Reading, Dancing, and Watching tv I love reading because I can learn so much about something without reading it in a boring way, unless its textbook. I love reading about World War II. My second hobby is dancing. I have loved dancing my whole life. Fun Fact I have been dancing since I was three years old! I used to do Tap, Jazz, and Ballet, but now I only dance ballet. Right now I am on pointe shoes which are tiring but a nice experience. my final hobby is watching tv. Ever since quarantine started I have been watching all types of tv series and movies. Some of the all-time best movies I have watched during quarantine is Star Wars, Back To The Future, Victorious, and more. All these hobbies made me who I am and I am happy that I like all my hobbies.
