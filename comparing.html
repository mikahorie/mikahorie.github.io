        <P>School is so different when you go to Japanese and American schools. 
          First of all, Japan keeps their schools so much cleaner and the 
          children do it.  In America on the other hand a person does it for us. 
          Secondly, the food that is given at school in Japan is so much 
          healthier and delicious. But in the American schools sadly the food 
          is not the best and very unhealthy.  In public schools in America 
          you donâ€™t wear uniforms. However when I went to Japan I assumed that 
          it was the same here but it was different. I found out that it 
          depended on the schools if they had uniforms or not. I also 
          realized that many of the schools Japan, students have to walk. 
          For the most part it is optional. I also found out that in 
          Japanese schools for elementary you have to buy a Ranndoseru. 
          In America however you can choose. For example my friend has a 
          backpack but I have a rolling backpack.  These are some of the 
          differences between Japanese school and American schools.
