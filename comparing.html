      <h3><P>
        If people ask me to pick a favorite school from one in Japan or in the US, I would choose…hmmm…. I can’t choose! Because each school has a unique fact.  School life in the US and Japan is so different. </P>

        <P>First of all, Japan keeps their schools so much cleaner and I was surprised to learn that the children actually clean their classrooms every single day! 
 In America, on the other hand, a person called janitor does everything for us. Secondly, the food that is served at school during lunch in Japan is so much healthier and delicious.  
 My favorite Japanese lunch was Gindara, fried rice and udon noodle. One thing I least liked about lunch was that each student had to drink a pack of milk.  
 It was a torture! But in American school the food is not the best and lunch is option is very limited and somewhat unhealthy.  
 Popular lunch menus are mac-n-cheese, hot dogs, hamburgers, buttered noodles, and PIZZA!</P>

 <P>Secondly, I realized that schools at the school I attend is very diverse with different cultures.
  If I think about it, more than half of my friends’ parents come from foreign countries, such as India, China, Japan, Romania, France, England, Cameroon and Ecuador. 
  Everyone speaks at least two languages and it’s very international.  However, schools in Japan seem like there is no diversity.  Maybe just a few multi-cultural students at each school. 
   It was very strange for me as I have been surrounded by different cultures and different types of people. </P> 

   <P>Thirdly, my school offers more enrichment classes such as daily foreign languages (Spanish, French and Mandarin-Chinese), weekly technology, and Growth Mindset also known as Social Emotional Learning.</P>

   <P>Oh, I forgot to mention that even though students in Japan can walk to and from school, it’s not allowed in the United States.  Parents have to drive us to school every morning and pick up in the afternoon. 
 I loved walking home with my friends while chatting in Japan. I miss it so much!</P>
